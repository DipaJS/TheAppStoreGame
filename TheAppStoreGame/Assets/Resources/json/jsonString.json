        "description": "This app is only for use by licensed officers of the City of Harrisonburg Police Department and may only be downloaded with affirmed consent from the City of Harrisonburg Police Department. This app will be used to expedite the search for and booking of convicted criminals in the City of Harrisonburg area. When a warrant is issued for an individual's arrest, their description and identifying characteristics are automatically entered into the app. Harrisonburg's facial detection system, enabled by traffic cameras on our major streets, will then be able to automatically locate, flag, and track any individual matching the description when they are seen by a camera. Officers logged in to the app can see the status of an arrest warrant and the location of any suspects. This innovative app will make for a more efficient police department and a safer City of Harrisonburg.",

Some citizens of Harrisonburg are not only worried about the short term consequences, but also the long term. “Facial recognition, identifying characteristics using surveillance cameras, what else is the government going to do, soon we’ll have no freedom at all”.\n\nHowever, not all have the same opinion regarding CrimeCognition. “I really think this is a big step against crime, and I will feel a lot safer now knowing that the police of Harrisonburg got more resources to catch criminals.”\n\nWe also had the chance to interview the COP of Harrisonburg and he shared his thoughts on CrimeCognition. “I don’t think people realize how much more effective this app allows us to be, not only do we save time and resources but we also have more at our disposal to keep the streets clean”.\n\nAlthough the opinion of this newly introduced app is rather divided, only time will tell how it will affect not only our community here at Harrisonburg but also how it will affect the world. Will CrimeCognition help lower the crime rate and the usage of the app will spread like wildfire, or will there be clear gender and racial bias due to an incomplete technology.",

What side are the government on and especially what side is the AppStore company on? How can we reject something that would clearly help us get rid of criminals and make our city a much safer place? I am in disbelief”. While others agree with rejecting CrimeCognition, “I think people fail to see the bigger picture, the technology is not quite ready yet and not only that, there might be more consequences if we give the police and government more power to govern us. First cameras everywhere and before you know it we will have surveillance in every corner in our city where we are being constantly watched.\n\nThere has been some dispute between the police and the AppStore. The police of Harrisonburg wants the app to be approved as it can benefit them tremendously to catch criminals and keep the city clean. We might see some actions taken by the police to have CrimeCognition approved.",

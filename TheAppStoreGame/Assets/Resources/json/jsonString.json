As soon as a warrant is issued for an individual’s arrest, their description and identifying characteristics are automatically entered into the app. CrimeCognition’s facial detection system, enabled by traffic cameras on our major streets, will then be able to automatically locate, flag, and track any individual matching the description when they are seen by a camera. Officers logged in to the app can see the status of an arrest warrant and the location of any suspects. This innovative app will make for a more efficient police department and make your city more safe.\n\nThis app is only for use by licensed officers of your city’s Police Department.",

The clear racial as well as gender bias is not something that should be a factor when it comes to crime.\n\nHowever, CrimeCognition has caused some people to rejoice. They feel that something more was needed to fight crime, some of them are Police Chief Directors where they view CrimeCognition as a new asset that will allow them to “Reduce crime rate, save resources and keep people safe”\n\nAlthough the opinion of CrimeCognition is rather divided, only time will tell how it will affect your city and the world. How will it change the crime rate, will the rate of innocent people in jail change and is CrimeCognition ready to be used in law?\nLastly, will “All are equal before the law”, hold true when CrimeCognition is used in every city.",

With their soaring stocks, growing power in the market and their influence in all parts of life, E has quietly been growing to something that we all depend on in recent years. In their latest endeavor, they have moved away from their previous focus on commerce and social media to instead look at improving the workplace.\n\nToday, we have a short interview with one employee working at a company that has recently integrated their E.Work Basic package into their system. While seeing a boost in revenue both from the respective news as well as having the Basic package improve efficiency around the clock, rumors have it that the employee morale is questionable.\n\n“It’s been some work to get used to, to say the least.” Our guest mentioned, highlighting the now predetermined workflow created in their workplace. “I’ve seen some of my colleagues be let go because of the performance during our assigned hours where we are directly monitored. This is even though they’ve substantially contributed to all work before E.Work, just that it happened during early or late hours. It feels like our senior staff have gotten way too focused on pure numbers and fail to understand that some people work differently.” Our contact continued, showing us warnings issued at their desk describing the exact time they were absent from their computer. “The increased wage is something I won’t complain about, but the workplace seems to get more and more disconnected from the human element I felt earlier.” \n\nE.Work have also presented early adopters of their Basic package with financial support during the first two years using the system, both to sweeten the deal and reward employees following the new, efficiency-based workplace habits. It is hard to say whether or not this new venture for the E brand will result in another industry hit, seeing as the opposition for the practices used grow by the numbers. But even then, we see a steady increase in companies deciding to implement Basic across the world with no indication that this will slow down.",

                "textToDisplay": "Pre-packaged supplements sound convenient since you can take them at one specific time, but is it just another fad? A recent study from Micro Science Lab investigated the bioavailability of the pre-packaged supplements from MaxHealth, one of the recent supplement companies rising in popularity. The study looked at how well the supplements were taken up in the body together and showed that some of the supplements would have a better effect if taken separately rather than combined. However, MaxHealth has stated clearly that the supplements can be taken together but customers are now upset and feel ripped off since they have been needing to buy more supplements than necessary to get the same effect. \n\nAnother criticism MaxHealth has been receiving lately is the choice in using plastic for their pre-packaged supplements. MaxHealth has responded by saying that a more environmentally friendly solution would make their product more expensive and not be appreciated by their customers. It remains to be seen how MaxHealth takes care of these issues.",

As companies become more aware of their environmental impact, the latest trends have shown companies switching from using plastic to more environmentally friendly materials such as bambu and paper. This has reduced the plastic consumption tremendously - but now a recoil in plastic consumption is observed. One of the main forces is considered to be the supplement company MaxHealth that is rapidly taking over the industry as a recent study shows that over 60% of the citys’ citizens are MaxHealth customers. They offer supplement subscriptions where personalized supplements are packaged in 500 grams of plastic per subscription. This has led to plastic usage being back at almost the same levels as before the transition from plastic to environmentally friendly materials.",

While not objecting to the advertised features of the application, the companies were quick to warn users about the proposed danger when using the technology involved and urging users to read more about the practices involved.\n\nNow facing multiple lawsuits, the NX company has refused any and all interviews, instead focusing on showing the positives and relative success of their release, citing the improved accuracy and numerous bug-fixes released to reduce the problems mentioned in this article.",

This is certainly only one of the things that RealFilter has been used for, other ones including occurrences of minors starving themselves to reach a certain body goal previewed by the application, as told by their parents. Even moreso, the most recent news concerning the application revolves around the act of identity theft, where tech aficionados have found a way to manipulate the backend of the application to gain even more control over features to the point where they can impersonate others.\n\nWhile this only covers a rather miniscule part of the massive user base that RealFilter has accrued, it does present the question - How do you balance the freedom to present technical achievements made in the recent years with the potential misuse that can happen when it is presented to literally anyone?",

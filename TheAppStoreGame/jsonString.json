This app will be used to expedite the search for and booking of convicted criminals in the City of Harrisonburg area. When a warrant is issued for an individual's arrest, their description and identifying characteristics are automatically entered into the app. Harrisonburg's facial detection system, enabled by traffic cameras on our major streets, will then be able to automatically locate, flag, and track any individual matching the description when they are seen by a camera. Officers logged in to the app can see the status of an arrest warrant and the location of any suspects. This innovative app will make for a more efficient police department and a safer City of Harrisonburg.",

However, more innocent people are being arrested due to how inaccurate the current technology is with body recognition as well as how racial and gender bias it is. This led to protests. As time goes on more and more actions similar to these may be set in motion for the purpose of the people's safety. Actions such as more cameras on the streets to prevent potential crime. To “dramatize” this event, not only can this be used on stationary cameras but also small drones or aircraft that keep a constant eye on the city.",
